# JavaObjectReplacer

Student project

Sometimes is neccesary to replace one object with another in whole system. Java doesn't provide built in way for doing that, so extra
code is needed. This code uses recursive descent along with java reflections to perform replacement.
This type of code can be useful everywhere, especialy with applicaton like Game Engines, that have one root elements, and everything else
are children of that element.

Ovaj kod menja jedan objekat sa druigm kroz celu hijerarhiju.
